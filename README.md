# Flywheel Inverted Pendulum – Team-1

As part of the COIL project, we are working together as an international team. There are six of us: three from Lisbon, Portugal, and three from Amsterdam, and we are participating in this international program as a single team. The goal of the project is to stabilize a flywheel-driven inverted pendulum. During the five-week program, we work in labs and online meetings, tackling challenging assignments each week. Along the way, we develop various skills, including Arduino programming, PID control, and working with sensors.

## 1. Project Motivation

Inverted pendulums are interesting because they are naturally unstable—without constant adjustment, they fall over. Balancing an inverted pendulum requires continuous control, which is why it’s a classic problem in control theory and engineering. By studying and stabilizing inverted pendulums, we can learn how to design systems that maintain balance and stability, which has applications in robotics, transportation, and many automated systems.
