# The project
As part of the COIL project, we are working together as an international team. There are six of us: three from Lisbon, Portugal, and three from Amsterdam, and we are participating in this international program as a single team. The goal of the project is to stabilize a flywheel-driven inverted pendulum. During the five-week program, we work in labs and online meetings, tackling challenging assignments each week. Along the way, we develop various skills, including Arduino programming, PID control, and working with sensors.

## 1. Github structure
Our github is split in 5 sections. The first section is [code](https://github.com/Technische-Natuurkunde-HvA/inverted-pendulum-international-team-1/tree/main/code). This is where everything we made in c++, python and csv. In the code folder we have one folder for everything made on the Amsterdam side and one for the Lisbon side. The next folder is [docs](https://github.com/Technische-Natuurkunde-HvA/inverted-pendulum-international-team-1/tree/main/docs) this is where more of the technical information about the project is found. Next up is [feedback](https://github.com/Technische-Natuurkunde-HvA/inverted-pendulum-international-team-1/tree/main/feedback). This is where supervisors gave feedback on the project, which is divided in 3 weeks. Then comes the folder [progress](https://github.com/Technische-Natuurkunde-HvA/inverted-pendulum-international-team-1/tree/main/progress), here is a documentation of everything we accomplished each week. And the last one; [visuals](https://github.com/Technische-Natuurkunde-HvA/inverted-pendulum-international-team-1/tree/main/visuals). This is where our viaual data is found, where you can find figures (pictures). Besides figures, there is also videos. This tab is split into an Amsterdam side and an Lisbon side.

## 3. Visuals and data
As descibed in the first part, you can find all the visuals under the folder [visuals](https://github.com/Technische-Natuurkunde-HvA/inverted-pendulum-international-team-1/tree/main/visuals). Under the tab [code](https://github.com/Technische-Natuurkunde-HvA/inverted-pendulum-international-team-1/tree/main/code) you can find .csv files which is data collected by measurements.
