# Flywheel Inverted Pendulum – Team-1
As part of the COIL project, we are working together as an international team. There are six of us: three from Lisbon, Portugal, and three from Amsterdam, and we are participating in this international program as a single team. The goal of the project is to stabilize a flywheel-driven inverted pendulum. During the five-week program, we work in labs and online meetings, tackling challenging assignments each week. Along the way, we develop various skills, including Arduino programming, PID control, and working with sensors.
