# About this document

This is a team document where you record your weekly progress. It is written in Markdown, which allows you to format content in a simple and readable way. The document is rendered directly in GitHub without the need for a compiler (unlike LaTeX). The syntax is relatively easy. An overview of commonly used Markdown syntax can be found here:  
https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/

Below you find an example of the sections that must be included in each weekly progress report.

Use the **same document for all weeks**. For each week, use the **same headers and subheaders**.

Use the GitHub repository to store important project files (code, visuals including videos and figures, data, etc.). If necessary refer to those files in this document using a hyperlink.
