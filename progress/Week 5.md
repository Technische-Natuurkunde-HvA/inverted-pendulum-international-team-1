# Week 5

## 1. Progress description


## 2. Code


## 3. Results
This week, on the Lisbon side, we solved the issue related to stabilizing the wheel in the center and maintaining its position. The wheel is now able to move from rest to the setpoint very quickly and remain stable for long periods of time, as shown in the timelapse video.

On the Amsterdam side, the wheel is now capable of starting from an upside-down position and rapidly reaching the top setpoint, which can also be seen in the video uploaded this week.

## 4. Reflection 
On the Lisbon side, the main issue we are currently facing is the lack of reliability of the AS5600 sensor, as it occasionally outputs angle measurements with significant errors.
