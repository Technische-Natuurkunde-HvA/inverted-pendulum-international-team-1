- Wonderful you have uploaded many files to your repository, including several videos. Please do not upload zip files though.
- Good idea you added subfolders to keep things organized. However, remember that the main purpose of using Github is to combine the work from Amsterdam and Lisbon – not to separate it into two different parts.
- Move the motor_encoder_simple.ino and the motor_encoder_simple_HvA.ino files to the correct folder, or delete them if they are not needed.
- It is excellent that you have included Arduino code in your weekly progress update. However, the first sketch may not work as intended. Have you tested it? Next time, please add a short explanation of the purpose and results of your code.
- The Python code is detailed and impressive. Please write all comments and text in English though.
- Next time, include graphs into your weekly progress markdown document, not just a reference to them. If you need help with Github, let us know. Also, it looks like a single combined graph of both output-response curves is missing.
- Finally, it is great to read you are improving the design of your wheel.

General recommendations to all teams:
- Place your weekly progress reports in reverse order, with the most recent week at the top.
- Do not be afraid of Markdown. If you wish, you could start by writing a basic text file in Word and later convert it to Markdown.
- Always add annotations or description to all graphs, pictures, videos, code and data you share in your weekly progress report. Do not assume these are self-explanatory; your readers rely on your explanations to understand their relevance and importance.
- The weekly progress reports form the foundation of your final written product. The more clear, detailed, and comprehensive your reports are, the better prepared you will be to complete your final product.
